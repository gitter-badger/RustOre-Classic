#RustOre#
RustOre is a tiny Minecraft Classic server. It is a Work in Progress and still lacks a lot of functionality.

#Functionality#
* Can send heartbeats (Visible on the minecraft.net serverlist)
* Spawns player on a tiny island in the middle of nowhere.

#Compiling and Running#
To build RustOre, you need to get Cargo and Rust (you can use rustup.sh for this).

After getting Cargo and Rust, you can run

> cargo build

to build the executable in the _target_ folder or you can run

> cargo run

to build and run the executable in the same command.
